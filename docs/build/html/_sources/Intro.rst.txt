Introduction
============

``candig_federation`` is a one of the services which make up the CanDIG v2 platform. It acts as an entry point for
all incoming requests made to CanDIG, passing it along to the specified service, federating the request among the
nodes in the CanDIG network and aggregating all the responses.

It is based off CanDIG's `Python Model Service` __.
